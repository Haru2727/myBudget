## Usgae

    As an avid traveller I want to be able to track my withdrawls and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling also giving users a fast way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important.  Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
